#### Options for Things We Can Create

##### Overall Structure of Content

###### Option 1: Entirely Written
 - We currently have everything in a scattered written format.

 We can bring everything together into one written curriculum.

 This would involve my rewriting the content and receiving feedback and support from team members, such as Dimxy and Mylo.

###### Option 2: Primarily Written, with some Video and Programmed Interactivity

In addition to coallescing all written material into a targeted tutorial series, as described in Option 1, we can also add a few videos into the presentation.

These videos would appear occasionally throughout the writing, and would provide some simple graphics and video demonstration of the most visually important concepts and processes.

###### Option 3: Full video, with accompanying written transcript

Alterantively, we can create a Udemy-like course that has a constant video presentation for the entire discussion of the Komodo software suite.

This would be suitable for display on an external site, such as Udemy, Lynda, or others.

#### Nature of Interactivity

- Quizzes
  - Scattered throughout the material,
- A support community
  - Monitored Discord channel for users going through the course
- Optional availability of access to a Komodo Developer, to assist in answering questions
  - Would come at an additional cost to the user
- A test chain (likely one that already exists) that allows users to record their completion of the course and questions on the blockchain
  - Users submit answers online. Our servers process questions and send a transaction as proof that records data of user's passing test
  - If we then draw this into the Hivebright profile, it would serve as an in-practice example of Komodo and blockchain power in action
- A possible test at the end with a Komodo team member, wherein we do a video interview to determine their qualifications
  - This may be something for third-party service providers

## Profile Badges and Certifications

### Completion Certificates

Completion Certificates are Elligible for 24 months, and then must be renewed by retaking the quizzes.

This allows a badge holder to expect a reasonable amount of time to capitalize on their completion of the course, and at the same time, Komodo can expect to renew and adjust community expectations on a regular time interval.

We can update the completion certificates in real time, and not worry about users who took it previously and may have missed a topic. We can assume that within the next 24 months, if they are an active ecosystem contributor, they will recomplete the course and take any new material into account.

There is no cost to a completion certificate. It is merely a matter of convenience for the community, and this provides a measurement that can be used for observation.

##### Level 1: Business Professional - Completion Certificate

Covers conceptual understandings only.

Online quizzes and interactivity only, using all automation. No in-person interactivity required.

##### Level 2: Community Contributor - Certificate and Recognition

A recognized community contributor has both surpassed the above quiz, and is involved with community support in some fashion.

For example, this can be someone who has proven that they understand Komodo, and are actively involved in supporting the community on an online and social level.

No additional quizzes are required. This is simply given out to anyone who has passed Level 1 and receives authorization from a Komodo Team Member.

This could also be given as a side badge, or a badge-within-a-badge.

For example, receiving a Level 1 badge puts a green circle on the lower corner of your profile picture.

Getting the Level 2 authorization puts a white star symbol within the green badge.

##### Level 3: Komodo Developer Track - Completion Certificate

Covers all beginner topics and tutorials, up to Step 14 of the (current) outline.

Online quizzes and interactivity only, using automation. No in-person interactivity required.

Encourages that the developer also list an additional skill set on their profile. This can be a certification in a programming language, or a full university-level degree.

Also encourages user to link to a Github or LinkedIn profile that demonstrates their work capabilities.

##### Level 4: Advanced Komodo Developer Track - Completion Certificate

Includes everything up to this point, and then additional quizzes and automated interactivity to finish the Learning Path Outline.

Encourages the display of additional skill sets, degrees, and a Github (or other) portfolio.

### Advanced Community Contributor

##### Level 5: Source Code Contributor - Authorized Recognition

This level of community recognition is for community members who pass all the above tests, and successfully contribute to the source code.

Once the user receives this badge, they get an additional section that opens up on their profile that allows them to manage their unique contribution to the source code.

That way, they can state what they contributed and worry about managing their personal presentation.

### Notary Node

This is also a side badge, and it is available to anywho who reaches Level 3 or above.

No person should be allowed to run for a notary node position until they have passed this test.

### Third-party Service Provider Authorization and Certification

This is for groups of individuals (who are also on Hivebright community)

##### Group Page: Authorized Third-party Service Provider

A third-party service provider must have at least two members.

Both members must reach Level 1 on their own, and at least one member must reach Level 4.

Once they have reached these levels of contribution, the group is required to submit an application.

As a part of the application process, they must do a video interview with a qualified Komodo team member. During the interview, the Komodo team member will ask them basic conceptual questions that they must answer without referencing the documentation.

They must also submit one simple portfolio piece that demonstrate their ability to utilize the Komodo API.

A third-party service provider must have a registered business that is a taxable organization in a recognized area of the world.

 Throughout our documentation, and across the website, service providers are ranked according to the points with which they represent.

 So, for each Level 1 badge holder within their organization, they receive one point.

 In addition, if they provide verified proof that they have certain recognized industry certifications and degrees, we can give them additional points.

 So, an accredited univeristy, or a highly reputable certification program: these are useful and we can add these into the mix.

The Komodo team adds these additional points at our own discretion. Steve can be the gatekeeper here.

These group profile pages are held in a separate portion of the Hivebright community, and are classified separately -- similar to the manner in which Facebook seperates users from Facebook Pages (which can be company-oriented).

We can create a set list of preferred certifications in our community.

For example, Red Hat's Engineering Certification is highly desirable. Same for some of the AWS courses, some things that represent a few languages, etc. 

We can also consider integrating with a review site here. This will allow the catalogue of all third-party service providers to get customers to recommend their work.

## Research

The following links provide conversation material. 

I am only seriously looking at b9labs, blockgeeks, canvas, and udemy as locations where we could house our video and interactive course content. 

Everything else is included as conversation material, to help us envision what we might possibly build. 

Keep in mind, we want the following things:

- A video course that takes a Normal Developer through the process of learning Komodo
 - This course can have prerequisite material, if needed, so that could allow us to require that the developer first do a course on blockchain basics etc., and that would save us from having to do everything from scratch
- A way to pull information about course work completion to our Hivebright users, and to display their progress on their profile pages and posts, thus serving as an incentive to learn Komodo
- A way to also reward and incentivize community participation
- We also need an external community and technology framework that already provides the necessary tech infrastructure for conducting and managing courses and quizzes, and recording progress. We do not want to build that ourselves.
- A possible certification management system
  - or third-party service providers, we'll want to be able to display and verify that third-party service providers are who they say they are
  - We'll want to be able to feature third-party service providers separately from the rest of users on Hivebright, much in the same way that a Facebook Page is separate from a Facebook User 

#### Canvas

Canvas is an open-source educational platform that provides most of the structure necessary to build and manage educational curriculum. 

It is primarily geared towards universities, but as of now, I'm not aware of any reason why we could not also integrate it as a part of our educational portal for our Hivebright community.

It may be easy, and it may not, though. We'd have to get involved to find out. I've looked at installing it on a server, and it can be done.

This would be extra resources from our team, but it would allow us to keep the data and user base within our community. If we decide to go with something like Udemy instead, those platforms would manage users and web infrastructure for us, but we would have less control long term.

## Additional Considerations

We want to limit the amount of exposure we have to infrastructure changes on external platforms. If possible, we would like to host all educational content, and to manage all user data.

At the same time, some of these external platforms, such as blockgeeks, have an established audience and many users. We are likely to gain users faster by connecting and building some material on these communities, and planning for regular outreach therein.

We need a balanced approach: buildling our own infrastructure, and connecting to popular hubs of blockchain developers. 

We have chosen Hivebright as our "internal" platform for developer profiles and social posting. Hivebright will allow developers to post and share work in our own community, while giving us more access to data that we currently do not have in Discord. 

I am assuming (?) that we intend to replace Discord with Hivebright eventually.

Hivebright has an API, so we can gather information about our users, as needed. 

We will need to integrate this community in some fashion into other popular social-media networks, including Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow, LinkedIn, GitHub, and maybe Twitter and Facebook. This can be as simple as giving the user the ability to make a post on Hivebright and have that post show up on their external social-media feeds. I'm not sure what options are available, but we will see. 

Then, we need to move/rewrite all our existing educational content and curriculum to a community that has a large network of developers. This could be blockgeeks or b9labs, or something else. Craftain is another potential resource, though I personally am not interested in their platform. 

In moving the content to this other community, we need to ensure that there is an infrastructure in place that allows us to manage educational progress and quizzes. We need to be able to access the results of user activity, and pull this data to user profiles on Hivebright. This will allow us to display user progress as a part of their community badges.

Hivebright also needs to allow users to gather together into sub communities for the purposes of creating Third-party Service Provider groups, Notary Node group candidates, and other possible sub-organizations within the Komodo ecosystem.

We'll want to make sure that all communities we emphasize (Hivebright and any blockchain developer hub/network) have an API, so that we can pull data and have the opportunity to utilize that data in blockchain-driven storytelling, later on. 

So, for example, we may wish to be able to make hashes of user data, insert that into a Komodo-driven ecosystem chain, and use this data to lock and verify user progress in the ecosystem. (If this sounds a bit ambiguous, it's because this idea is ambiguous. I'm not sure yet what our specific use of blockchain-driven community activity would be, but I want the option available whenever we have the chance to take it.)
