# Outline for a Third-Party Service Provider Certification Course

## Intended Audience

- We are looking for students who expect to become third-party service providers
  - These are community-driven developers and business entrepreneurs that desire to assist people around the globe in creating new blockchain-related projects
- Each service provider can be a team of multiple members
  - At least one member must be competent in at least one mainstream programming language
  - Ideally, each team member should have at least two team members
    - Both team members should be able to complete the course
    - Therefore, both team members should be capable of basic computer skills, including scripting, API interaction, etc.
  - The second team member does not necessarily need to be professionally competent and experienced in a mainstream programming language; s/he only needs to be able to complete the course
- They should be able to spend at least 5 hours a week for several weeks in order to finish the course
- Prospective users who are already familiar with Komodo technology (such as existing third-party service providers) are still expected to do all quizzes related to the course, and to pass the oral exam, and to meet any other requirements

## Udemy Course

- Udemy course follows the same material provided in our current Learning Path outline
- The content must be converted to video format
- We will rarely use fully illustrative graphics
- Instead, we will use high quality screen sharing and a hand-drawn whiteboard and style for drawing out concepts, when needed
- The Udemy course will not have any cost at this time (however, the oral test will)
- Completing the course alone, without taking the test afterwards, gives the user a certificate of completion on their Hivebright profile
- Total runtime of the course is about 20 hours
- Covers everything for a Normal Developer
  - Does not cover advanced dev topics

## Test

- Search for 3 to 5 potential service providers
    - Search takes place on Twitter, Blog, Reddit, Discord, and a limited amount of blockchain-user platforms, such as blockgeeks
- The test costs $200 to take, and includes one retake, if the user fails the first time
- Test taker must have completed the Udemy course beforehand
- They also must complete the advanced content on the Learning Path outline
- Test taker must include a portfolio in their application
  - If their portfolio is not suitable, $165 of their original $200 fee is returned to them. The $35 is kept for processing (and to discourage abuse of the submission process)
- Test taker prepare by ensuring they have access to our video/screen sharing platform
  - We can use Zoom, Google, or Discord for video streaming and screen sharing
- Questions are standardized, but are open ended
  - We are looking to listen to their responses, making sure that we are finding people who can actually provide the necessary service
  - Questions will involve role play
  - We will have a set checklist that we use to measure their response
- We may consider limiting the total number of spots available at first
  - Perhaps a total of 25 spots or something
  - This would create a little scarcity for a year or two, which might drive demand
    - (Compare to the way that tech platforms will create invite-only beta versions during beta periods, to encourage networking among users)
  - After a year or two, we open this up to anyone
- Types of tested material
  - Conceptual proficiency
    - Taker is asked questions that require them to describe how they would solve a client's problem, speaking only on a conceptual level
  - Technical proficiency
    - Taker is asked to complete a preset test where they answer questions about how they would solve a technical problem
    - They provide answers in a form, and we measure their responses accordingly
  - Test can also include questions that demonstrate that they are capable of providing some type of customer support, even if that is simply in the online community
- After test completion, we email results to them later, allowing time to review. Amount of time should be set and consistent.

Once complete, certification continues for so long as they are able to bring in at least one new dPoW customer every 12 months, or maintain at least 5 customers on their account in total

Third-party service providers receive a special ability on the Hivebright platform that allows them to coalesce several users into a team.

The teams receive special status on the site, and are also included in recommendations and marketing materials
(This is not an endorsement blah blah blah)
